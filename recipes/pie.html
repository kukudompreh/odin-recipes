    <h4><em>Traditional Irish pie</em></h4>
    <p>â€Ž </p>
    <p> This <strong>Irish apple pie</strong> recipe is from my mum. She was from Cork in southern Ireland, so I'm guessing the recipe is Irish and possibly the same one her mother taught her. As a little boy, I grew up helping my mum make apple and fruit pies. <em>Sadly</em>, she is no longer with us, but her legendary apple pie lives on in my memory. I promise you will love this pie. Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

            <li>Make crust: Combine flours, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter and shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in sour cream and lemon juice until dough comes together; some lumps are okay. Divide dough in half and shape into 2 disks. Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. </h1>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie dish. </li>
            <li>Roll 1 dough disk out to fit the prepared 9-inch pie dish. Roll out remaining dough disk for top crust; set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare filling: Place apples into crust in the pie dish. Stir together sugar, flour, and nutmeg in a small bowl; sprinkle over apples. Drizzle with lemon juice. </li>
            <li>Brush outer edge of bottom crust with beaten egg. Cover with top crust; trim and crimp edges together. Brush top with beaten egg and cut 4 steam vents.</li>
